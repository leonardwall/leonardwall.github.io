[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am solutions-driven Cyber Security Operations Leader with a successful history of driving the design and implementation of high-level security plans to enhance security of personnel, property, and proprietary information across the organizations. My history of professional acumen and leadership skills has led to a solid background in monitoring company networks and deploying firewalls, security appliances, and security software to protect private information, while documenting incidents and responses in written reports and presenting recommendations to upper management. Furthermore, I am instrumental in identifying and patching critical loopholes, maximizing the effectiveness of security controls and staying ahead of current risks.\nIn the past, I have successfully optimized operational frameworks and attained pre-identified benefits by balancing conflicting demands between programs and projects while allocating resources supported by organizational priorities and capacity. I have reduced repair costs and avoided downtime by conducting major upgrades and through maintenance scheduling throughout the lifecycle of security tools; and ensured security against advanced cyberattacks, hacking, and persistent threats by designing, developing, and implementing security solutions/designs, software, hardware, policies. I believe, with my proven record of accomplishment, I can deliver the same and even better results in the future. Among my peers, I am recognized as an eloquent verbal and written communicator with the innate ability to articulate and toggle quickly between “big picture” and “finer details”. I am a leader who can easily foster a culture of teamwork, promote synergy, and new ideas for business development process.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://leonardwall.github.io/author/leonard-wall/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/leonard-wall/","section":"authors","summary":"I am solutions-driven Cyber Security Operations Leader with a successful history of driving the design and implementation of high-level security plans to enhance security of personnel, property, and proprietary information across the organizations.","tags":null,"title":"Leonard Wall","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590062400,"objectID":"2f05055f49dcd0e49891ea91c5defff7","permalink":"https://leonardwall.github.io/talk/secure-programming/","publishdate":"2020-09-12T14:29:32-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/secure-programming/","section":"talk","summary":"We are excited to announce the May virtual lunch and learn opportunity, Secure Programming, facilitated by Leonard Wall!
